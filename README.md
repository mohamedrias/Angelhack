# Angelhack Treve- a simple way to keep track of the things you borrow and lend

We made this app in less than 24 hours at Angelhack LA. We tried to use ClusterPoint for DB and Hp idol on demand for user authentication. We run into some trouble with the lack of documentation on both which slowed us down quite a lot. HP would eventually ask us to write a guide for their API that weekend.
